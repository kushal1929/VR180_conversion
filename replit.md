# VR180 Video Converter

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that converts regular 2D videos into VR 180Â° format videos. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to upload videos, monitor AI-powered processing with real-time progress tracking, preview results, and download the converted VR videos. Built with React frontend and Node.js backend, it features a modern design using shadcn/ui components and handles large video file uploads with comprehensive error handling.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom color variables and dark mode support
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **File Handling**: React Dropzone for drag-and-drop file uploads

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **File Processing**: Multer for handling multipart/form-data uploads
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg integration for video metadata extraction and conversion
- **Storage Pattern**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation (designed for future database integration)
- **Development Setup**: Vite middleware integration for development with hot module replacement

### Data Storage Solutions

### API Structure
- **RESTful Design**: Standard REST endpoints for video operations
- **Upload Endpoint**: POST `/api/videos/upload` with file size limits (500MB)
- **Progress Tracking**: GET endpoints for real-time processing status
- **Download Endpoints**: Separate endpoints for VR and mobile VR formats
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with structured JSON responses

### Video Processing Pipeline
- **Multi-Step Processing**: Organized into distinct steps (depth analysis, stereoscopic generation, quality enhancement, final rendering)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for each processing step
- **Metadata Extraction**: Automatic video analysis for duration, resolution, and format validation
- **Output Formats**: Dual output generation for standard VR and mobile-optimized VR formats

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Schema Ready**: User authentication schema defined with username/password structure
- **Session Infrastructure**: Prepared session management system
